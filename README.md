# Peripheral

**Planetary physics-enabled game engine with realtime vector terrain manipulation, made with [Matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js) and [paper.js](https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/)**

## Development plan

 - Map textures onto the background (and foreground?)
 - Explosion design / animation
 - Item icons
 - Character design
   - Character could maybe be a wall-e esque robot floating with a thruster
 - Make something akin to a sandbox/editor where I can at least draw and/or export vectors
