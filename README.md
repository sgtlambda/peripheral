## Development plan

- Explosions: cool sound
- Map textures onto the background (and foreground?)
- Explosion design / animation
- Item icons
- Character design
    - Character could maybe be a wall-e esque robot floating with a thruster
- Make something akin to a sandbox/editor where I can at least draw and/or export vectors

## Level idea

- Hostage negotiation
- Something apocalyptic
