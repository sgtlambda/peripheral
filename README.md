## TODOs

- Convert DTO classes to simple typed objects
- Explosions should "blow away" nearby characters and objects
- Explosion design / animation
- Hitscannig / raycasting
- Item icons
- Try interesting stage design (with ropes / wires)
- Character could maybe be a wall-e esque robot floating with a thruster.
